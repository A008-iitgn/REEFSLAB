            <p>India has vast potential for geothermal energy, with medium- to high-enthalpy resources in the Himalayas and low-enthalpy reservoirs in both eastern and western India. However, despite this recognized potential and the ever-increasing energy needs of India, no geothermal pilot or direct application has been attempted. This is mostly due to subsurface uncertainties regarding temperatures, flow parameters, and reservoir size that increase investment risk. The proposed exploratory research project aims to reduce this uncertainty by developing outcropping reservoir analogues and thus helping to unlock the geothermal potential of India.
